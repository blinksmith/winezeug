call does not come from an untrusted source that could have added formatting
characters that the code is not prepared to handle.  Additionally, the format

Many program execution commands under Windows will search
the path for a program if you do not explicitly specify a full path to the file. This can allow trojans to be executed instead. Also, be sure to
specify a file extension, since otherwise multiple extensions will be tried
by the operating system, providing another opportunity for trojans.

Check to be sure that the format string passed as argument 2 to this function
call does not come from an untrusted source that could have added formatting
characters that the code is not prepared to handle.  Additionally, the format
string could contain `%s' without precision that could result in a buffer
overflow.

Many program execution commands under Windows will search
the path for a program if you do not explicitly specify a full path to the file. This can allow trojans to be executed instead. Also, be sure to
specify a file extension, since otherwise multiple extensions will be tried
by the operating system, providing another opportunity for trojans.

specify a file extension, since otherwise multiple extensions will be tried
by the operating system, providing another opportunity for trojans.

The filename argument of open should be carefully checked if it is being created with any user-supplied string as a compontent of it. Strings should be checked for occurences of path backtracking/relative path components (../ as an example), or nulls, which may cause the underlying C call to interpret the filename to open differently than expected. It is also important to make sure that the final filename does not end in a "|", as this will cause the path to be executed.

When setting signal handlers, do not use the same function to handle multiple signals. There exists the possibility a race condition will result if 2 or more different signals are sent to the process at nearly the same time. Also, when writing signal handlers, it is best to do as little as possible in them. The best strategy is to use the signal handler to set a flag, that another part of the program tests and performs the appropriate action(s) when it is set.

name, for example, by pulling 64 bits of randomness from /dev/random, base 64 encoding it and using that as a file suffix.
